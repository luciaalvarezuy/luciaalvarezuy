### <!--Hi there 👋-->
 Hi 👋 I'm Lucía
 
 I'm a research psychologist and data scientist with a strong interest in modeling human behavior to support evidence-based decisions in organizations. My work bridges psychology, data science, and psychometrics — from measuring individual differences and well-being to developing tools that assess programs, interventions, or populations.
 
 I enjoy honing and learning new skills.     

I’m especially passionate about:

- Understanding how people think, decide, and change over time

- Building and validating measurement tools

- Applying statistical and machine learning models to behavioral data

 Feel free to ask me any questions 😄.

 The list of publications in peer-reviewed journals can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WpzOV1EAAAAJ&hl=es). 
 
 Currently, I am part of the [Data Science and Psychometrics](https://fundamentos.psico.edu.uy/programas/ciencia-de-datos) teaching group at the University of the Republic of Uruguay.
